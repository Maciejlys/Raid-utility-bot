# About the project

Simple bot that fetches all nicknames from an event\
created using [Raid-Helper](https://raid-helper.com/)\
and sends them as an invite macro to the author

# Example usage

If our last created event has an id of 123456\
you simply go to channel where the event was created and type\
!inv 123456\
This message should be deleted and DM with invite macro\
should be sent to the author
